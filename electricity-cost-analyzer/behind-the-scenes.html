        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>Our Electricity Cost Analyzer is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. The calculator functionality is powered by JavaScript, which allows us to perform real-time calculations based on user input. We use a simple algorithm to estimate electricity costs based on appliance usage and time of use, taking into account the electricity rate provided by the user.</p>
        <p>We also maintain a library of common appliances and their average power consumption, which
users can select from when adding appliances to their calculation. This library is regularly updated to ensure accuracy and relevance.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to provide a user-friendly and informative tool that helps people understand their electricity costs and make informed decisions about their energy usage. We are committed to continuous improvement and welcome feedback from our users to enhance the functionality and user experience of our calculator.</p>
